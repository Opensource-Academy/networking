# Networking 103 - SSH

## Description

SSH, or secure shell, is an encrypted protocol used to connect to other machines, such as servers. 

SSH is usualy how you interact with, for example, an Ubuntu server.

> If you finished the Git course, you worked with SSH keys before.

DigitalOcean has a very complete introduction to SSH [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys).

> DigitalOcean has a lot of guides on getting started with servers and other networking related topics. Their guides are excellent starting points for quickly learning something new.
