# Networking 102 - Networking basics

## HTTP

It's time to talk about the HTTP protocol in a guide that will walk you through a lot of things you might have used or seen before, but maybe never really thought about.

The article covers everything from status codes to urls, it's time to learn about [http](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177).

### Play with it!

Now that you had an introduction to HTTP, play with it. If you finished the python course, you can try the examples below. The same is of course possible with other programming languages and packages.

#### Flask and curl
If you completed the Python course, try to set up a Flask server and use curl to interact with it. Make Flask print every request and response and you get a nice visual representation of what was discussed in the articles in Networking 101 and the article you just read.

#### Add requests
Now do the same thing as last time, but this time, don't use curl, but use the requests module you learned about in the Python course.

## Security

If you have not already done so, now is a great time to also look into the [security](https://github.com/Opensource-Academy/security) course.
